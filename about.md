Welcome to Paleomedia.org 2.x. I am a journalist, editor of [The Blue Review] (http://thebluereview.org) and critical technologist. I also wrote [a book] (http://amorandexile.com) that chronicles the love stories of American citizens and their partners who are in the country illegally. I occasionally blog about the media, technology, the West and the world. Feel free to shout back [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/paleomedia).
